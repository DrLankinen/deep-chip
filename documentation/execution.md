## Structure


## Memory and Time Complexity
MCTS algorithm is much more complex than I'm use to which is why I searched the result instead of calculating it. There was whole paper about this topic which I briefly read while writing project definition. That said the time and memory complexity is the same as it was in project definition.
```
Time complexity: O(mkI)
Memory complexity: O(mk)
```
where *m* number of random children we expand, *k* is the number of times we simulate each child state, and *I* is the number of iterations [1].
