## What ways tested?
Texas Holdem poker contains randomness which makes it hard to create comprehensive tests. In DeepStack paper the authors also talked about this same problem and how in short game the better player might lose [1]. They mentioned how in some previous work even 80,000 games wasn't nessesary enough to choose the better player [1]. They used a method called AIVAT. In the constraints of this project I probably don't have time to do this. The metric researchers use is mbb/g which means milli-big-blinds per game (big blinds is the bigger starting bet one person need to do every round). According to DeepStack paper professional poker players consider 50 mbb/g margin performance [1]. DeepStack achieved 492 mbb/g [1]. I would be happy if this could achieve the level of professional player.
