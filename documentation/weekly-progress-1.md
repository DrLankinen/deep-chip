This week I studied the algorithms people use for this and tried to understand better what works for me. I ended choosing Monte Carlo tree search because it's pretty good and I probably get at least some kind of results. I assume that it requires at least one day of training but hopefully, it doesn't require too much to train it far enough to play even decently. If the time isn't enough I might need to add some hand made rules to make sure it doesn't do anything stupid like put all-in every time.

I haven't started writing any code. I wrote product definition but also got some intuition about how the algorithm will work. I also read some articles about the state of the art algorithms and tried to get some intuition of those. I have a pretty solid understanding of the game so it probably helps me to evaluate the moves.

This week I learned how Monte Carlo tree search works in high level, Texas holdem no-limit complexity and how people have tried to solve it.

The fear is that I try to achieve too much and don't get this to work. I have prior knowledge about reinforcement learning and it feels like I understand this enough to implement. I didn't want to take a too simple game and GO didn't felt interesting because I don't know how to play it.

The next week I will start by studying more about the environment I will be using. Hopefully, I also have time to start writing the algorithm to understand how it works. Because the game is really big and contain randomness I might need to test the algorithm using something simpler like tic-tac-toe.
