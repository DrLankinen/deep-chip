This week I continued writing code and did more tests. I also tried different structures for the project after having problems with imports.

I'm probably on the schedule. I wasn't available to do a lot of tests because the important parts of the code are still in progress. I spent some times understanding how to do test coverage report. It took some time but I didn't had enough time to implement it.

This week I learned more about Python imports and how tests work. I also learned fully how MCTS works after realizing a couple of missing points in my knowledge.

Tests and test coverages are causing some problems. I haven't found any good examples of those online. There are some documenations I will read the next week. I also had some problems with my computer when I tried to upgrade Python 3.6 to 3.7 which took some time.

The next week I will finnish the final parts of the code and hopefully I'm available to test it. I will also add more tests and some kind of reports about the test coverage. I will also check that the code follows pep8 rules which I didn't had time to do this week.

I spent 20 hours this week
