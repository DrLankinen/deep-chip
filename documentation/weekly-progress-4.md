This week I finnished the core functionality of the program. The next thing is to fix the bugs that are in the program. Because of my careful coding this step shouldn't be very hard. I also added more tests but as soon as I get the core functionality better condition I can create even more.

This week the program progressed pretty well. I haven't started implementing own data structures but that is pretty easy step relative to what I have done.

This week I learned better how pypokerengine works and notice a couple of things that could have helped me. I also learned a little bit better what kind of modifications I could make to reduce the state space using domain knowledge. If I have enough time I might test different options if there is big improvement.

The biggest problem is that I started building this in a way that it took me three weeks to get the core algorithm work in a way that I can test it. Probably I should have split it into smaller induvitual pieces that I could have tested.

The next week I will fix the code and add tests to see if it's working. My testing approach is to first create the code, then create the test, and then fix everything that doesn't go through. I was a possibility to thought about some other project structure to do more testings along the way but I don't think this is a problem.
