This week I added more tests and made the current tests work better. The code is still not fully working. The way I try to fix the code is that I run it and everytime it stops to some bug I fix it. After the code is ready I can tests everything. This week I also added the required things like code coverage report, thought about the structure, and added some documents.

This week the core functionality of the project didn't progress as much as previous weeks because I needed to do documenting and testing I have postponed previous weeks.

This week I learned better how testing, test coverage, etc. works in Python but I also learned to document the project.

Right now I don't have any problems.

The next week I try to fix the code so that I could test everything and hopefully see the algorithm in action. If I want to get this to the point I originally planed before the deadline I probably need to get the code working the next week. The thing that takes at least one week is testing. I looked some ways to test Texas Holdem poker algorithm and notice that it's pretty hard. There are programs I can use but learning and integrating those might take a while.
